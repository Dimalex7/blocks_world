A Python project for solving the "Blocks World" problem using search algorithms, developed for an Artificial Intelligence course.

## Features

- Implements both blind (DFS, BFS) and heuristic (Best-First, A*) search
- Uses PDDL files for problem definition (initial/goal states)
- Outputs step-by-step solutions to a text file
- Includes custom heuristic function for A*
